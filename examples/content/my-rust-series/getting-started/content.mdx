# Getting Started with Rust

In this first part of the series, we'll install Rust and write our first program.

## Installation

The easiest way to install Rust is using rustup:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Verify your installation:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Hello, World!

Create a new project:

```bash
cargo new hello-world
cd hello-world
```

Open `src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Run it:

```bash
cargo run
```

Congratulations! You've written your first Rust program.

## Next Steps

In the next part of this series, we'll explore Rust's ownership system.
