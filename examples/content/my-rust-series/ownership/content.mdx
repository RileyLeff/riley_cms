# Understanding Ownership

Ownership is Rust's most unique feature and enables memory safety without a garbage collector.

## The Rules

Rust's ownership system has three rules:

1. Each value has an **owner**
2. There can only be **one owner** at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is **dropped**

## Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2

    // println!("{}", s1); // ERROR: s1 is no longer valid
    println!("{}", s2); // OK
}
```

## Borrowing

Instead of transferring ownership, you can **borrow** a value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1); // borrow s1

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}", s1, len); // s1 is still valid
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

## Why Ownership?

Ownership prevents:
- Use after free
- Double free
- Data races

All at compile time, with zero runtime cost.
