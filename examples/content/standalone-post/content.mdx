# My First Post

Welcome to your blog powered by **riley_cms**!

## What is riley_cms?

riley_cms is a minimal, self-hosted CMS designed for personal blogs. It follows a simple philosophy:

- **Git is your database** for content
- **S3/R2 is your database** for assets
- **The API is stateless glue** that serves it all

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply:

1. Create a new directory in your `content/` folder
2. Add a `config.toml` with your post metadata
3. Add a `content.mdx` with your post content
4. Push to git (or use `riley_cms push`)

```bash
mkdir content/my-new-post
cd content/my-new-post
```

That's it! Your content is now ready to be served.

## MDX Support

Since this is MDX, you can use React components in your content:

<Callout type="info">
  This is a callout component rendered by your frontend!
</Callout>

Happy blogging!
